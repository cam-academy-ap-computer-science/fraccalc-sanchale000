Extra Credit Error Handling: 2/4

I removed points for Input Parsing because you left your debug printouts in the final program.
Your math all works perfectly, but your method of calculating the gcd is SO slow that on
some large numbers I couldn't wait long enough to get an answer.  I'm not sure if it ever would
have gotten to an answer or not.  I replaced your gcd function with a quicker one, and was then
able to run all the other tests and confirm that all your other logic was correct.

Your error handling did great with divide by zero conditions.  It couldn't handle 1 ++ 3, though,
or 3_3_3 / 2, so 2 points extra credit.
